## Data Science Course in a Box

Data Science in a Box contains the materials required to teach (or learn from) an introductory data science course using R, all of which are freely-available and open-source.
They include course materials such as slide decks, homework assignments, guided labs, sample exams, a final project assignment, as well as materials for instructors such as pedagogical tips, information on computing infrastructure, technology stack, and course logistics.

See [datasciencebox.org](https://datasciencebox.org/) for everything you need to know about the project!

## Questions, bugs, feature requests

You can file an issue to get help, report a bug, or make a feature request.

Before opening a new issue, be sure to [search issues and pull requests](https://github.com/rstudio-education/datascience-box/issues) to make sure the bug hasn't been reported and/or already fixed in the development version.
By default, the search will be pre-populated with `is:issue is:open`.
You can [edit the qualifiers](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues-and-pull-requests/) (e.g. `is:pr`, `is:closed`) as needed.
For example, you'd simply remove `is:open` to search *all* issues in the repo, open or closed.

If your issue involves R code, please make a minimal **repr**oducible **ex**ample using the [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) package.
If you haven't heard of or used reprex before, you're in for a treat!
Seriously, reprex will make all of your R-question-asking endeavors easier (which is a pretty insane ROI for the five to ten minutes it'll take you to learn what it's all about).
For additional reprex pointers, check out the [Get help!](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/)
section of the tidyverse site.
