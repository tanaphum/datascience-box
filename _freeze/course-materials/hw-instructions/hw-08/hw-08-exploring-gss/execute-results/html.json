What are the possible responses to this question and how many respondents chose each of these answers?\n\n2.  What percent of the respondents for whom this question is applicable\\\n    (i.e. excluding `NA`s and `Does not apply`s) have been harassed by their superiors or co-workers at their job.\n\nüß∂ ‚úÖ ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Knit, *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is cleared up afterwards.*\n\n## Part 2: Time spent on email\n\nThe 2016 GSS also asked respondents how many hours and minutes they spend on email weekly.\nThe responses to these questions are recorded in the `emailhr` and `emailmin` variables.\nFor example, if the response is 2.5 hrs, this would be recorded as `emailhr = 2` and `emailmin = 30`.\n\n3.  Create a new variable called `email` that combines these two variables to reports the number of minutes the respondents spend on email weekly.\n\n4.  Visualize the distribution of this new variable.\n    Find the mean and the median number of minutes respondents spend on email weekly.\n    Is the mean or the median a better measure of the typical among of time Americans spend on email weekly?\n    Why?\n\n5.  Create another new variable, `snap_insta` that is coded as \"Yes\" if the respondent reported using any of Snapchat (`snapchat`) or Instagram (`instagrm`), and \"No\" if not.\n    If the recorded value was `NA` for both of these questions, the value in your new variable should also be `NA`.\n\n6.  Calculate the percentage of Yes's for `snap_insta` among those who answered the question, i.e. excluding `NA`s.\n\n7.  What are the possible responses to the question *Last week were you working full time, part time, going to school, keeping house, or what?* and how many respondents chose each of these answers?\n    Note that this information is stored in the `wrkstat` variable.\n\n8.  Fit a model predicting `email` (number of minutes per week spent on email) from `educ` (number of years of education), `wrkstat`, and `snap_insta`.\n    Interpret the slopes for each of these variables.\n\n9.  Create a predicted values vs. residuals plot for this model.\n    Are there any issues with the model?\n    If yes, describe them.\n\nüß∂ ‚úÖ ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Knit, *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is cleared up afterwards.*\n\n## Part 3: Political views and science research\n\nThe 2016 GSS also asked respondents whether they think of themselves as liberal or conservative (`polviews`) and whether they think science research is necessary and should be supported by the federal government (`advfront`).\n\n-   The question on science research is worded as follows:\n\n> Even if it brings no immediate benefits, scientific research that advances the frontiers of knowledge is necessary and should be supported by the federal government.\n\nAnd possible responses to this question are Strongly agree, Agree, Disagree, Strongly disagree, Don't know, No answer, Not applicable.\n\n-   The question on political views is worded as follows:\n\n> We hear a lot of talk these days about liberals and conservatives.\n> I'm going to show you a seven-point scale on which the political views that people might hold are arranged from extremely liberal--point 1--to extremely conservative--point 7.\n> Where would you place yourself on this scale?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.marginfigure .cell-code}\n**Note:** The levels of this variables are spelled inconsistently: \"Extremely liberal\" vs. \"Extrmly conservative\". Since this is the spelling that shows up in the data, you need to make sure this is how you spell the levels in your code.\n```\n:::\n\n\nAnd possible responses to this question are Extremely liberal, Liberal, Slightly liberal, Moderate, Slghtly conservative, Conservative, Extrmly conservative.\nResponses that were originally Don't know, No answer and Not applicable are already mapped to `NA`s upon data import.\n\n10. In a new variable, recode `advfront` such that Strongly Agree and Agree are mapped to `\"Yes\"`, and Disagree and Strongly disagree are mapped to `\"No\"`.\n    The remaining levels can be left as is.\n    Don't overwrite the existing `advfront`, instead pick a different, informative name for your new variable.\n\n11. In a new variable, recode `polviews` such that Extremely liberal, Liberal, and Slightly liberal, are mapped to `\"Liberal\"`, and Slghtly conservative, Conservative, and Extrmly conservative disagree are mapped to `\"Conservative\"`.\n    The remaining levels can be left as is.\n    Make sure that the levels are in a reasonable order.\n    Don't overwrite the existing `polviews`, instead pick a different, informative name for your new variable.\n\n12. Create a visualization that displays the relationship between these two new variables and interpret it.\n\nüß∂ ‚úÖ ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Knit, *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is cleared up afterwards and review the md document on GitHub to make sure you're happy with the final state of your work.*\n\n[^hw-08-exploring-gss-1]: Smith, Tom W, Peter Marsden, Michael Hout, and Jibum Kim.\n    General Social Surveys, 1972-2016 [machine-readable data file] /Principal Investigator, Tom W.
