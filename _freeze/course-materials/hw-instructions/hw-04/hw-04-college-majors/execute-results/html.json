If anything is missing, commit and push again.\n\n## Packages\n\nWe'll use the **tidyverse** package for much of the data wrangling and visualisation, the **scales** package for better formatting of labels on visualisations, and the data lives in the **fivethirtyeight** package.\nThese packages are already installed for you.\nYou can load them by running the following in your Console:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(fivethirtyeight)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Data\n\nThe data can be found in the **fivethirtyeight** package, and it's called `college_recent_grads`.\nSince the dataset is distributed with the package, we don't need to load it separately; it becomes available to us when we load the package.\nYou can find out more about the dataset by inspecting its documentation, which you can access by running `?college_recent_grads` in the Console or using the Help menu in RStudio to search for `college_recent_grads`.\nYou can also find this information [here](https://fivethirtyeight-r.netlify.app/reference/college_recent_grads.html).\n\nYou can also take a quick peek at your data frame and view its dimensions with the `glimpse` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglimpse(college_recent_grads)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe `college_recent_grads` data frame is a trove of information.\nLet's think about some questions we might want to answer with these data:\n\n-   Which major has the lowest unemployment rate?\n-   Which major has the highest percentage of women?\n-   How do the distributions of median income compare across major categories?\n-   Do women tend to choose majors with lower or higher earnings?\n\nIn the next section we aim to answer these questions.\n\n# Exercises\n\n## Which major has the lowest unemployment rate?\n\nIn order to answer this question all we need to do is sort the data.\nWe use the `arrange` function to do this, and sort it by the `unemployment_rate` variable.\nBy default `arrange` sorts in ascending order, which is what we want here -- we're interested in the major with the *lowest* unemployment rate.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncollege_recent_grads %>%\n  arrange(unemployment_rate)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis gives us what we wanted, but not in an ideal form.\nFirst, the name of the major barely fits on the page.\nSecond, some of the variables are not that useful (e.g. `major_code`, `major_category`) and some we might want front and center are not easily viewed (e.g. `unemployment_rate`).\n\nWe can use the `select` function to choose which variables to display, and in which order:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.marginfigure .cell-code}\nNote how easily we expanded our code with adding another step to our pipeline,\nwith the pipe operator: `%>%`.\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncollege_recent_grads %>%\n  arrange(unemployment_rate) %>%\n  select(rank, major, unemployment_rate)\n```\n:::\n\n\nOk, this is looking better, but do we really need to display all those decimal places in the unemployment variable?\nNot really!\n\nWe can use the `percent()` function to clean up the display a bit.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncollege_recent_grads %>%\n  arrange(unemployment_rate) %>%\n  select(rank, major, unemployment_rate) %>%\n  mutate(unemployment_rate = percent(unemployment_rate))\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Which major has the highest percentage of women?\n\nTo answer such a question we need to arrange the data in descending order.\nFor example, if earlier we were interested in the major with the highest unemployment rate, we would use the following:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.marginfigure .cell-code}\nThe `desc` function specifies that we want `unemployment_rate` in descending order.\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncollege_recent_grads %>%\n  arrange(desc(unemployment_rate)) %>%\n  select(rank, major, unemployment_rate)\n```\n:::\n\n\n1.  Using what you've learned so far, arrange the data in descending order with respect to proportion of women in a major, and display only the major, the total number of people with major, and proportion of women. Show only the top 3 majors by adding `top_n(3)` at the end of the pipeline.\n\n## How do the distributions of median income compare across major categories?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.marginfigure .cell-code}\nA percentile is a measure used in statistics indicating the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations fall. For example, the 20th percentile is the value below which 20% of the observations may be found. (Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThere are three types of incomes reported in this data frame: `p25th`, `median`, and `p75th`.\nThese correspond to the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of the income distribution of sampled individuals for a given major.\n\n2.  Why do we often choose the median, rather than the mean, to describe the typical income of a group of people?\n\nThe question we want to answer \"How do the distributions of median income compare across major categories?\".\nWe need to do a few things to answer this question: First, we need to group the data by `major_category`.\nThen, we need a way to summarize the distributions of median income within these groups.\nThis decision will depend on the shapes of these distributions.\nSo first, we need to visualize the data.\n\nWe use the `ggplot()` function to do this.\nThe first argument is the data frame, and the next argument gives the mapping of the variables of the data to the `aes`thetic elements of the plot.\n\nLet's start simple and take a look at the distribution of all median incomes, without considering the major categories.\n\n\n::: {.cell height='2'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = college_recent_grads, mapping = aes(x = median)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n```\n:::\n\n\nAlong with the plot, we get a message:\n\n    `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\nThis is telling us that we might want to reconsider the binwidth we chose for our histogram -- or more accurately, the binwidth we didn't specify.\nIt's good practice to always think in the context of the data and try out a few binwidths before settling on a binwidth.\nYou might ask yourself: \"What would be a meaningful difference in median incomes?\" \\$1 is obviously too little, \\$10000 might be too high.\n\n3.  Try binwidths of \\$1000 and \\$5000 and choose one. Explain your reasoning for your choice. Note that the binwidth is an argument for the `geom_histogram` function. So to specify a binwidth of \\$1000, you would use `geom_histogram(binwidth = 1000)`.\n\nWe can also calculate summary statistics for this distribution using the `summarise` function:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncollege_recent_grads %>%\n  summarise(min = min(median), max = max(median),\n            mean = mean(median), med = median(median),\n            sd = sd(median), \n            q1 = quantile(median, probs = 0.25),\n            q3 = quantile(median, probs = 0.75))\n```\n:::\n\n\n4.  Based on the shape of the histogram you created in the previous exercise, determine which of these summary statistics is useful for describing the distribution.\n    Write up your description (remember shape, center, spread, any unusual observations) and include the summary statistic output as well.\n\n5.  Plot the distribution of `median` income using a histogram, faceted by `major_category`.\n    Use the `binwidth` you chose in the earlier exercise.\n\nNow that we've seen the shapes of the distributions of median incomes for each major category, we should have a better idea for which summary statistic to use to quantify the typical median income.\n\n6.  Which major category has the highest typical (you'll need to decide what this means) median income? Use the partial code below, filling it in with the appropriate statistic and function. Also note that we are looking for the highest statistic, so make sure to arrange in the correct direction.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncollege_recent_grads %>%\n  group_by(major_category) %>%\n  summarise(___ = ___(median)) %>%\n  arrange(___)\n```\n:::\n\n\n7.  Which major category is the least popular in this sample? To answer this question we use a new function called `count`, which first groups the data and then counts the number of observations in each category (see below). Add to the pipeline appropriately to arrange the results so that the major with the lowest observations is on top.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncollege_recent_grads %>%\n  count(major_category)\n```\n:::\n\n\n🧶 ✅ ⬆️ Knit, *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.

Which STEM majors have median salaries equal to or less than the median for all majors' median earnings? Your output should only show the major name and median, 25th percentile, and 75th percentile earning for that major as and should be sorted such that the major with the highest median earning is on top.\n\n🧶 ✅ ⬆️ Knit, *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.
