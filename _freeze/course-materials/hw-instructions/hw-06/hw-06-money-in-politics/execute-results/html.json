We will want this information when we ultimately have data from all years, so this is a good time to keep track of it. Our function doesn't take a year argument, but the year is embedded in the URL, so we can extract it out of there, and add it as a new column. Use the `str_sub()` function to extract the last 4 characters from the URL. You will probably want to look at the help for this function to figure out how to specify \"last 4 characters\".\n\n-   Define the URLs for 2022, 2020, and 2000 contributions.\n    Then, test your function using these URLs as inputs.\n    Does the function seem to do what you expected it to do?\n\n-   Construct a vector called `urls` that contains the URLs for each webpage that contains information on foreign-connected PAC contributions for a given year.\n\n-   Map the `scrape_pac()` function over `urls` in a way that will result in a data frame called `pac_all`.\n\n-   Write the data frame to a csv file called `pac-all.csv` in the `data` folder.\n\n*‚úÖ‚¨ÜÔ∏è If you haven't yet done so, now is definitely a good time to commit and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message (e.g. \"Data scraping complete\"). Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is cleared up afterwards.*\n\n<div>\n\nComplete the following set of steps in the `hw-06.Rmd` file in your repository.\n\n</div>\n\n1.  In your R Markdown file, load `pac-all.csv` and report its number of observations and variables using inline code.\n\n## Data cleaning\n\nIn this section we clean the `pac_all` data frame to prepare it for analysis and visualization.\nWe have two goals in data cleaning:\n\n-   Separate the `country_parent` into two such that country and parent company appear in different columns for country-level analysis.\n\n-   Convert contribution amounts in `total`, `dems`, and `repubs` from character strings to numeric values.\n\nThe following exercises walk you through how to make these fixes to the data.\n\n2.  Use the `separate()` function to separate `country_parent` into `country` and `parent` columns.\n    Note that country and parent company names are separated by `\\` (which will need to be specified in your function) and also note that there are some entries where the `\\` sign appears twice and in these cases we want to only split the value at the first occurrence of `\\`.\n    This can be accomplished by setting the `extra` argument in to `\"merge\"` so that the cell is split into only 2 segments, e.g. we want `\"Denmark/Novo Nordisk A/S\"` to be split into `\"Denmark\"` and `\"Novo Nordisk A/S\"`.\n    (See help for `separate()` for more on this.) End your code chunk by printing out the top 10 rows of your data frame (if you just type the data frame name it should automatically do this for you).\n\n3.  Remove the character strings including `$` and `,` signs in the `total`, `dems`,and `repubs` columns and convert these columns to numeric.\n    End your code chunk by printing out the top 10 rows of your data frame (if you just type the data frame name it should automatically do this for you).\n    A couple hints to help you out:\n\n    -   The `$` character is a special character so it will need to be escaped.\n\n    -   Some contribution amounts are in the millions (e.g. Anheuser-Busch contributed a total of \\$1,510,897 in 2008).\n        In this case we need to remove all occurrences of `,`, which we can do by using `str_remove_all()` instead of `str_remove()`.\n\nüß∂ ‚úÖ ‚¨ÜÔ∏è *Now is a good time to knit your document, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is cleared up afterwards.*\n\n## Data visualization and interpretation\n\n4.  Create a line plot of total contributions from all foreign-connected PACs in the Canada and Mexico over the years.\n    Once you have made the plot, write a brief interpretation of what the graph reveals.\n    Few hints to help you out:\n\n    -   Filter for only `Canada` and `Mexico`.\n    -   Calculate sum of total contributions from PACs for each year for each country by using a sequence of `group_by()` then `summarise()`.\n    -   Make a plot of total contributions (y-axis) by year (x-axis) where two lines identified by different colours represent each of Canada and Mexico.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.marginfigure .cell-code}\n**Note:** The figure you create might look slightly different than this one if the data on the website has been updated recently.\n```\n:::\n\n\n4.  Recreate the following visualisation. Once you have made the plot, write a brief interpretation of what the graph reveals. Note that these are only UK contributions. You will need to make use of functions from the **scales** package for axis labels as well as from **ggplot2**.\n\n\n::: {.cell fig.fullwidth='true'}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\n‚Ñπ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](hw-06-money-in-politics_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nüß∂ ‚úÖ ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Knit, *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.
