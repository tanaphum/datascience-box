What are the three most common first names of purchasers?\n\n2.  What are the three most common themes of Lego sets purchased?\n\n3.  Among the most common theme of Lego sets purchased, what is the most common subtheme?\n\nüß∂ ‚úÖ ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Knit, *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.

Create a new variable called `age_group` and group the ages into the following categories: \"18 and under\", \"19 - 25\", \"26 - 35\", \"36 - 50\", \"51 and over\".\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.marginfigure .cell-code}\n**Hint:** You will need to consider quantity of purchases.\n```\n:::\n\n\n5.

Which Lego theme has made the most money for Lego?\n\n8.  Which area code has spent the most money on Legos?\n    In the US the area code is the first 3 digits of a phone number.\n\n9.  Come up with a question you want to answer using these data, and write it down.\n    Then, create a data visualization that answers the question, and explain how your visualization answers the question.\n\nüß∂ ‚úÖ ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Knit, *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.
