Create a data frame that can be used to re-construct this visualisation. You may need to guess some of the numbers, that's ok. You should first think about how many rows and columns you'll need and what you want to call your variables. Then, you can use the `tribble()` function for this. For example, if you wanted to construct the following data frame\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  date     count\n  <chr>    <dbl>\n1 1/1/2020    15\n2 2/1/2020    20\n3 3/1/2020    22\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nyou can write\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf <- tribble(\n  ~date, ~count,\n  \"1/1/2020\", 15,\n  \"2/1/2020\", 20,\n  \"3/1/2020\", 22,\n)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.marginfigure .cell-code}\nSince the exercises for this week are short it's possible not every team member will get to commit and push **during** the workshop. However each team member should review what was created, fix typos, make edits for better presentation, etc. either during or after the workshop, and before the deadline.\n```\n:::\n\n\n2.  Make a visualisation that more accurately (and honestly) tells the story.\n\n3.  What message is more clear in your visualisation than it was in the original visualisation?\n\n4.  What, if any, useful information do these data and your visualisation tell us about mask wearing and COVID?\n    It'll be difficult to set aside what you already know about mask wearing, but you should try to focus only on what this visualisation tells.\n    Feel free to also comment on whether that lines up with what you know about mask wearing.\n\n🧶 ✅ ⬆️ Knit, *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is cleared up afterwards and review the md document on GitHub to make sure you're happy with the final state of your work.*\n",
