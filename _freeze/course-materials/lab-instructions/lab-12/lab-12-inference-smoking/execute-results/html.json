What are the cases in this data set? How many cases are there in our sample?\n\nThe first step in the analysis of a new dataset is getting acquainted with the data.\nMake summaries of the variables in your dataset, determine which variables are categorical and which are numerical.\nFor numerical variables, are there outliers?\nIf you aren't sure or want to take a closer look at the data, make a graph.\n\n## Baby weights\n\nA 1995 study suggests that average weight of Caucasian babies born in the US is 3,369 grams (7.43 pounds).[^lab-12-inference-smoking-1]\nIn this dataset we only have information on mother's race, so we will make the simplifying assumption that babies of Caucasian mothers are also Caucasian, i.e. `whitemom = \"white\"`.\n\nWe want to evaluate whether the average weight of Caucasian babies has changed since 1995.\n\nOur null hypothesis should state \"there is nothing going on\", i.e. no change since 1995: $H_0: \\mu = 7.43~pounds$.\n\nOur alternative hypothesis should reflect the research question, i.e. some change since 1995.\nSince the research question doesn't state a direction for the change, we use a two sided alternative hypothesis: $H_A: \\mu \\ne 7.43~pounds$.\n\n3.  Create a filtered data frame called `ncbirths_white` that contain data only from white mothers.\n    Then, calculate the mean of the weights of their babies.\n\n4.  Are the conditions necessary for conducting simulation based inference satisfied?\n    Explain your reasoning.\n\nLet's discuss how this test would work.\nOur goal is to simulate a null distribution of sample means that is centred at the null value of 7.43 pounds.\nIn order to do so, we\n\n-   take a bootstrap sample of from the original sample,\n-   calculate this bootstrap sample's mean,\n-   repeat these two steps a large number of times to create a bootstrap distribution of means centred at the observed sample mean,\n-   shift this distribution to be centred at the null value by subtracting / adding X to all bootstrap mean (X = difference between mean of bootstrap distribution and null value), and\n-   calculate the p-value as the proportion of bootstrap samples that yielded a sample mean at least as extreme as the observed sample mean.\n\n5.  Run the appropriate hypothesis test, visualize the null distribution, calculate the p-value, and interpret the results in context of the data and the hypothesis test.\n\n## Baby weight vs. smoking\n\nConsider the possible relationship between a mother's smoking habit and the weight of her baby.\nPlotting the data is a useful first step because it helps us quickly visualize trends, identify strong associations, and develop research questions.\n\n6.  Make side-by-side boxplots displaying the relationship between `habit` and `weight`.\n    What does the plot highlight about the relationship between these two variables?\n\n7.  Before moving forward, save a version of the dataset omitting observations where there are NAs for `habit`.\n    You can call this version `ncbirths_habitgiven`.\n\nThe box plots show how the medians of the two distributions compare, but we can also compare the means of the distributions using the following to first group the data by the `habit` variable, and then calculate the mean `weight` in these groups using.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nncbirths_habitgiven %>%\n  group_by(habit) %>%\n  summarise(mean_weight = mean(weight))\n```\n:::\n\n\nThere is an observed difference, but is this difference statistically significant?\nIn order to answer this question we will conduct a hypothesis test .\n\n7.  Write the hypotheses for testing if the average weights of babies born to smoking and non-smoking mothers are different.\n\n8.  Are the conditions necessary for conducting simulation based inference satisfied?\n    Explain your reasoning.\n\n9.  Run the appropriate hypothesis test, calculate the p-value, and interpret the results in context of the data and the hypothesis test.\n\n10. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the difference between the average weights of babies born to smoking and non-smoking mothers.\n\n## Baby weight vs. mother's age\n\nIn this portion of the analysis we focus on two variables.\nThe first one is `maturemom`.\n\n11. First, a non-inference task: Determine the age cutoff for younger and mature mothers. Use a method of your choice, and explain how your method works.\n\nThe other variable of interest is `lowbirthweight`.\n\n12. Conduct a hypothesis test evaluating whether the proportion of low birth weight babies is higher for mature mothers. State the hypotheses, verify the conditions, run the test and calculate the p-value, and state your conclusion in context of the research question. Use $\\alpha = 0.05$. If you find a significant difference, construct a confidence interval, at the equivalent level to the hypothesis test, for the difference between the proportions of low birth weight babies between mature and younger mothers, and interpret this interval in context of the data.\n\n[^lab-12-inference-smoking-1]: Wen, Shi Wu, Michael S.
