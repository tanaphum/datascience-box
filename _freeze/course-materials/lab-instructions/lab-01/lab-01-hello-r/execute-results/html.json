At this point you should also make sure that the course organization shows up for you under *Organization access*. If it does not, this means you have not yet accepted the GitHub invitation to join the course, and you should go back and do that.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/github-auth-4.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   Once you're done, both of these boxes should be checked.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/github-auth-5.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   To confirm that you've successfully linked up your GitHub and RStudio Cloud accounts, [GitHub settings \\> Applications](https://github.com/settings/applications).

It stands for \"YAML Ain't Markup Language\". It is a human friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages. All you need to know is that this area is called the YAML (we will refer to it as such) and that it contains meta information about your document.\n```\n:::\n\n\n### YAML\n\nOpen the R Markdown (Rmd) file in your project, change the author name to your name, and knit the document.\n\n\n::: {.cell fig.fullwidth='true'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/yaml-raw-to-rendered.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Committing changes\n\nThen go to the Git pane in your RStudio.\n\nIf you have made changes to your Rmd file, you should see it listed here.\nClick on it to select it in this list and then click on **Diff**.\nThis shows you the *diff*erence between the last committed state of the document and its current state that includes your changes.\nIf you're happy with these changes, write \"Update author name\" in the **Commit message** box and hit **Commit**.\n\n\n::: {.cell fig.fullwidth='true'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/update-author-name-commit.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou don't have to commit after every change, this would get quite cumbersome.\nYou should consider committing states that are *meaningful to you* for inspection, comparison, or restoration.\nIn the first few assignments we will tell you exactly when to commit and in some cases, what commit message to use.\nAs the semester progresses we will let you make these decisions.\n\n### Pushing changes\n\nNow that you have made an update and committed this change, it's time to push these changes to the web!\nOr more specifically, to your repo on GitHub.\nWhy?\nSo that others can see your changes.\nAnd by others, we mean the course teaching team (your repos in this course are private to you and us, only).\n\nIn order to push your changes to GitHub, click on **Push**.\nThis will prompt a dialogue box where you first need to enter your user name, and then your password.\nThis might feel cumbersome.\nBear with me... We *will* teach you how to save your password so you don't have to enter it every time.\nBut for this one assignment you'll have to manually enter each time you push in order to gain some experience with it.\n\n## Packages\n\nIn this lab we will work with two packages: **datasauRus** which contains the dataset we'll be using and **tidyverse** which is a collection of packages for doing data analysis in a \"tidy\" way.\nThese packages are already installed for you.\nYou can load the packages by running the following in the Console.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse) \nlibrary(datasauRus)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNote that the packages are also loaded with the same commands in your R Markdown document.\n\n## Data\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.marginfigure .cell-code}\nIf it's confusing that the data frame is called `datasaurus_dozen` when it contains 13 datasets, you're not alone! Have you heard of a [baker's dozen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dozen#Baker's_dozen)?\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe data frame we will be working with today is called `datasaurus_dozen` and it's in the `datasauRus` package.\nActually, this single data frame contains 13 datasets, designed to show us why data visualisation is important and how summary statistics alone can be misleading.\nThe different datasets are marked by the `dataset` variable.\n\nTo find out more about the dataset, type the following in your Console: `?datasaurus_dozen`.\nA question mark before the name of an object will always bring up its help file.\nThis command must be ran in the Console.\n\n# Exercises\n\n1.  Based on the help file, how many rows and how many columns does the `datasaurus_dozen` file have? What are the variables included in the data frame?

ACM, 2017.\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe original Datasaurus (`dino`) was created by Alberto Cairo in [this great blog post](http://www.thefunctionalart.com/2016/08/download-datasaurus-never-trust-summary.html).\nThe other Dozen were generated using simulated annealing and the process is described in the paper *Same Stats, Different Graphs: Generating Datasets with Varied Appearance and Identical Statistics* through Simulated Annealing by Justin Matejka and George Fitzmaurice.\nIn the paper, the authors simulate a variety of datasets that have the same summary statistics as the Datasaurus but have very different distributions.\n\n🧶 ✅ ⬆️ *Knit, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message \"Added answer for Ex 1\".

Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between `x` and `y` for this dataset.\n\nBelow is the code you will need to complete this exercise.\nBasically, the answer is already given, but you need to include relevant bits in your Rmd document and successfully knit it and view the results.\n\nStart with the `datasaurus_dozen` and pipe it into the `filter` function to filter for observations where `dataset == \"dino\"`.\nStore the resulting filtered data frame as a new data frame called `dino_data`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndino_data <- datasaurus_dozen %>%\n  filter(dataset == \"dino\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThere is a lot going on here, so let's slow down and unpack it a bit.\n\nFirst, the pipe operator: `%>%`, takes what comes before it and sends it as the first argument to what comes after it.\nSo here, we're saying `filter` the `datasaurus_dozen` data frame for observations where `dataset == \"dino\"`.\n\nSecond, the assignment operator: `<-`, assigns the name `dino_data` to the filtered data frame.\n\nNext, we need to visualize these data.\nWe will use the `ggplot` function for this.\nIts first argument is the data you're visualizing.\nNext we define the `aes`thetic mappings.\nIn other words, the columns of the data that get mapped to certain aesthetic features of the plot, e.g. the `x` axis will represent the variable called `x` and the `y` axis will represent the variable called `y`.\nThen, we add another layer to this plot where we define which `geom`etric shapes we want to use to represent each observation in the data.\nIn this case we want these to be points, hence `geom_point`.\n\n\n::: {.cell fig.fullwidth='true'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = dino_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lab-01-hello-r_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf this seems like a lot, it is.\nAnd you will learn about the philosophy of building data visualizations in layer in detail next week.\nFor now, follow along with the code that is provided.\n\nFor the second part of these exercises, we need to calculate a summary statistic: the correlation coefficient.\nCorrelation coefficient, often referred to as $r$ in statistics, measures the linear association between two variables.\nYou will see that some of the pairs of variables we plot do not have a linear relationship between them.\nThis is exactly why we want to visualize first: visualize to assess the form of the relationship, and calculate $r$ only if relevant.\nIn this case, calculating a correlation coefficient really doesn't make sense since the relationship between `x` and `y` is definitely not linear -- it's dinosaurial!\n\nBut, for illustrative purposes, let's calculate the correlation coefficient between `x` and `y`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.marginfigure .cell-code}\nStart with `dino_data` and calculate a summary statistic that we will call `r` as the `cor`relation between `x` and `y`.\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndino_data %>%\n  summarize(r = cor(x, y))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n        r\n    <dbl>\n1 -0.0645\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n🧶 ✅ ⬆️ *Knit, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message \"Added answer for Ex 2\".
