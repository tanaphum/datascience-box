Load the data by including the appropriate code in your R Markdown file.\n\n## Simple linear regression\n\n2.  Fit a linear model (one you have fit before): `score_bty_fit`, predicting average professor evaluation `score` based on average beauty rating (`bty_avg`) only. Write the linear model, and note the $R^2$ and the adjusted $R^2$.\n\nüß∂ ‚úÖ ‚¨ÜÔ∏è *If you haven't done so recently, knit, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is cleared up afterwards.*\n\n## Multiple linear regression\n\n3.  Fit a linear model (one you have fit before): `score_bty_gen_fit`, predicting average professor evaluation `score` based on average beauty rating (`bty_avg`) and `gender`.\n    Write the linear model, and note the $R^2$ and the adjusted $R^2$.\n\n4.  Interpret the slopes and intercept of `score_bty_gen_fit` in context of the data.\n\n5.  What percent of the variability in `score` is explained by the model `score_bty_gen_fit`.\n\n6.  What is the equation of the line corresponding to *just* male professors?\n\n7.  For two professors who received the same beauty rating, which gender tends to have the higher course evaluation score?\n\n8.  How does the relationship between beauty and evaluation score vary between male and female professors?\n\n9.  How do the adjusted $R^2$ values of `score_bty_gen_fit` and `score_bty_fit` compare?\n    What does this tell us about how useful `gender` is in explaining the variability in evaluation scores when we already have information on the beauty score of the professor.\n\n10. Compare the slopes of `bty_avg` under the two models (`score_bty_fit` and `score_bty_gen_fit`).\n    Has the addition of `gender` to the model changed the parameter estimate (slope) for `bty_avg`?\n\n11. Create a new model called `score_bty_rank_fit` with `gender` removed and `rank` added in.\n    Write the equation of the linear model and interpret the slopes and intercept in context of the data.\n\nüß∂ ‚úÖ ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Knit, *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.
