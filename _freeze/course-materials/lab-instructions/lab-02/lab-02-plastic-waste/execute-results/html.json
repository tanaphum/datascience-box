Without looking, can you name them all and briefly describe their purpose?\n-   Verify that the dataset has loaded into the Environment. How many observations are in the dataset? Clicking on the dataset in the Environment will allow you to inspect it more carefully. Alternatively, you can type `View(plastic_waste)` into the Console to do this.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.marginfigure .cell-code}\n**Hint:** If you're not sure, run the command `?NA` which will lead you to the documentation.\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   Have a quick look at the data and notice that there are cells taking the value `NA` -- what does this mean?\n\n# Exercises\n\nLet's start by taking a look at the distribution of plastic waste per capita in 2010.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = plastic_waste, aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: Removed 51 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_bin()`).\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lab-02-plastic-waste_files/figure-html/plastic_waste_per_cap-hist-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOne country stands out as an unusual observation at the top of the distribution.\nOne way of identifying this country is to filter the data for countries where plastic waste per capita is greater than 3.5 kg/person.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplastic_waste %>%\n  filter(plastic_waste_per_cap > 3.5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 1 √ó 10\n  code  entity              continent     year gdp_per_cap plastic_waste_per_cap\n  <chr> <chr>               <chr>        <dbl>       <dbl>                 <dbl>\n1 TTO   Trinidad and Tobago North Ameri‚Ä¶  2010      31261.                   3.6\n# ‚Ñπ 4 more variables: mismanaged_plastic_waste_per_cap <dbl>,\n#   mismanaged_plastic_waste <dbl>, coastal_pop <dbl>, total_pop <dbl>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nDid you expect this result?\nYou might consider doing some research on Trinidad and Tobago to see why plastic waste per capita is so high there, or whether this is a data error.\n\n1.  Plot, using histograms, the distribution of plastic waste per capita faceted by continent. What can you say about how the continents compare to each other in terms of their plastic waste per capita?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.marginfigure .cell-code}\n**NOTE:** From this point onwards the plots and the output of the code are not displayed in the lab instructions, but you can and should the code and view the results yourself.\n```\n:::\n\n\nAnother way of visualizing numerical data is using density plots.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = plastic_waste, aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +\n  geom_density()\n```\n:::\n\n\nAnd compare distributions across continents by colouring density curves by continent.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = plastic_waste, \n       mapping = aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap, \n                     color = continent)) +\n  geom_density()\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe resulting plot may be a little difficult to read, so let's also fill the curves in with colours as well.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = plastic_waste, \n       mapping = aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap, \n                     color = continent, \n                     fill = continent)) +\n  geom_density()\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe overlapping colours make it difficult to tell what's happening with the distributions in continents plotted first, and hence covered by continents plotted over them.\nWe can change the transparency level of the fill color to help with this.\nThe `alpha` argument takes values between 0 and 1: 0 is completely transparent and 1 is completely opaque.\nThere is no way to tell what value will work best, so you just need to try a few.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = plastic_waste, \n       mapping = aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap, \n                     color = continent, \n                     fill = continent)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.7)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis still doesn't look great...\n\n1.  Recreate the density plots above using a different (lower) alpha level that works better for displaying the density curves for all continents.\n\n2.  Describe why we defined the `color` and `fill` of the curves by mapping aesthetics of the plot but we defined the `alpha` level as a characteristic of the plotting geom.\n\nüß∂ ‚úÖ ‚¨ÜÔ∏è *Now is a good time to knit your document and commit and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is cleared up afterwards.*\n\nAnd yet another way to visualize this relationship is using side-by-side box plots.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = plastic_waste, \n       mapping = aes(x = continent, \n                     y = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n```\n:::\n\n\n1.  Convert your side-by-side box plots from the previous task to [violin plots](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_violin.html). What do the violin plots reveal that box plots do not? What features are apparent in the box plots but not in the violin plots?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.marginfigure .cell-code}\n**Remember:** We use `geom_point()` to make scatterplots.\n```\n:::\n\n\n1.  Visualize the relationship between plastic waste per capita and mismanaged plastic waste per capita using a scatterplot.\n    Describe the relationship.\n\n2.  Colour the points in the scatterplot by continent.\n    Does there seem to be any clear distinctions between continents with respect to how plastic waste per capita and mismanaged plastic waste per capita are associated?\n\n3.  Visualize the relationship between plastic waste per capita and total population as well as plastic waste per capita and coastal population.\n    You will need to make two separate plots.\n    Do either of these pairs of variables appear to be more strongly linearly associated?\n\nüß∂ ‚úÖ ‚¨ÜÔ∏è *Now is another good time to knit your document and commit and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.

One country with plastic waste per capita over 3 kg/day has been filtered out. And the data are not only represented with points on the plot but also a smooth curve. The term \"smooth\" should help you [pick which geom to use](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html#section-geoms).\n```\n:::\n\n\n1.
