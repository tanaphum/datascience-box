as needed the instructor(s) are able to install and update software, change configurations, restart or kill sessions, and monitor all aspects of the system.\nThis does increase the demands on the instructor and any involved IT staff, but we have found the benefits to far outweigh the costs.\nOne other unforeseen benefit to a centralized approach is that it makes it possible to present large scale analytic tasks that would not be possible on a traditional desktop or laptop.\nFor example, advanced courses can include homework assignments where students need to process a dataset that is on the order of several hundred gigabytes in size, which would not be possible if they were required to use their own system.\n\n## Dockerized RStudio server\n\nA second approach to running RStudio server involves the construction and hosting of a farm of individualized Docker container instances.\nA sketch of the architecture of the Docker containers is in the figure below, which shows that students authenticate via university login which redirects them to a personal RStudio instance running in a Docker container on either a local or cloud based server.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Dockerized RStudio server](images/alt-docker.png){fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nDocker is a popular and rapidly evolving containerization tool suite that allows users to automate the deployment of software in a repeatable and self-contained way.\nEach container wraps a portion of the file system in such a way that all of the code, runtimes, tools, and libraries needed for a piece of software are available, meaning that software will always run in exactly the same way regardless of the environment in which it is being run.\nAs such, Docker is a powerful tool for reproducible computational research, since every Dockerfile transparently and clearly defines exactly what software and which version is being used for any particular computation task.\n\nAn additional advantage of Docker containers is that they are similar to virtual machines in that they are sandboxed from one another.\nBy mapping each student to a single container we are able to keep all student processes segregated and enforce strict CPU, memory, and disk usage quotas to avoid accidental disruption of the work of one another.\n\nHowever Docker containers are generally lighter weight than virtual machines, in terms of system resources used.\nThis makes it feasible to run a large number of containers on a single system at the same time.\nSince most RStudio usage (particularly by our introductory students) is intermittent, we have found that it is possible to run more than 100 RStudio containers concurrently on a single server.\nServers can be run locally or on a cloud-based service.\nThe cost for the latter can be defrayed by the credits many services offer for academic use.\n\nFurther details of a containerized RStudio server approach implemented at Duke can be found at [here](https://github.com/mccahill/docker-rstudio).\nThis repository contains a README which explains how the large-scale container farm is set up and also contains the Dockerfiles that are used to create the individual containers.\n\nImplementing the infrastructure solutions discussed above can be overwhelming and time consuming.\nWe encourage faculty interested in adopting these tools to partner with their departmental and/or university IT professionals.\nAdditionally, building these partnerships can lead to collaborations that benefit the entire university.\n\n## Learn more\n\nIf you would like to learn more about computing infrastructure for statistics and data science courses, we recommend the following paper.\n\n> Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, M., & Rundel, C.\n> (2018).\n> Infrastructure and tools for teaching computing throughout the statistical curriculum.\n> *The American Statistician*, 72(1), 58-65.\n> [doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2017.1397549](https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2017.1397549)\n\nA freely available version of the paper can be found [here](https://peerj.com/preprints/3181/).\n",
