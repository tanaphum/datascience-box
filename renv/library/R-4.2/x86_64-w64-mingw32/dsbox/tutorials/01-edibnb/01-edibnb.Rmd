## Introduction

```{r grassmarket, fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.cap="Photo by Madeleine Kohler on Unsplash"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/madeleine-kohler-90Qn643Pq9c-unsplash.jpg")
```

Recent developments in Edinburgh regarding the growth of Airbnb and its impact on the housing market means a better understanding of the Airbnb listings is needed. Using data provided by Airbnb, we can explore how Airbnb availability and prices vary by neighbourhood.

The data come from the [Kaggle database](https://www.kaggle.com/thoroc/edinburgh-inside-airbnb/version/2), and was originally distributed by [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) on 25 June 2019.

The data has been modified to better serve the goals of this exploration.

### Learning goals

The goal of this tutorial is not to conduct a thorough analysis of Airbnb listings in Edinburgh, but instead to give you a chance to practice your data visualisation and interpretation skills.

### Packages

We'll use the `tidyverse` package for this analysis and the `dsbox` package for the data. Run the following code to load this package.

```{r load-packages, exercise=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dsbox)
```

```{r load-packages-solution}
library(tidyverse)
library(dsbox)
```

```{r load-packages-check}
grade_this_code("The tidyverse and dsbox packages are now loaded!")
```


## Data

### Load and glimpse

The data is in the `dsbox` package and it's called `edibnb`. 

You can view the data using

```{r glimpse-data, exercise=TRUE}
glimpse(edibnb)
```

### Getting to know your data

```{r quiz-rows}
question("What does each row in the `edibnb` dataset represent?",
    answer("The values of a certain variable"),
    answer("An individual Airbnb listing",
           correct = TRUE,
           message = "Each row in the dataset contains one observation of each field, each relating to a single Airbnb listing."),
    answer("An Airbnb booking"),
    answer("An Edinburgh neighbourhood")
  )
```

### Number of observations

How many Airbnb listings are included in this dataset? Use the following code block to find out.

```{r edibnb-nrow, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r edibnb-nrow-hint-1}
nrow(___)
```

```{r edibnb-nrow-check}
grade_this({
  if(identical(.result, 13245) | identical(.result, 13245L)) {
    pass("There are 13245 observations in the dataset.")
  }
  if(identical(.result, 10) | identical(.result , 10L)) {
    fail("There are 13245 observations in the dataset.")
  }
  fail("Not quite. Each observation is represented in one row. Can you remember which function we use to calculate the number of rows?")
})
```

### Examining further

Each column represents a variable. We can get a list of the variables in the data frame using the `names()` function.

```{r edibnb-names, exercise=TRUE}
names(edibnb)
```

The variables and their descriptions are given below:

| Variable Name   |  Description
|:----------------|:--------------------------------
| `id` | ID number of the listing
| `price` | Price, in GBP, for one night stay
| `neighbourhood` | Neighbourhood listing is located in
| `accommodates` | Number of people listing accommodates
| `bathrooms` | Number of bathrooms
| `bedrooms` | Number of bedrooms
| `beds` | Number of beds (which can be different than the number of bedrooms)
| `review_scores_rating` | Average rating of property
| `number_of_reviews` | Number of reviews
| `listing_url` | Listing URL


## Data visualisation

### Building a histogram

Create a histogram of the distribution of Airbnb listing prices (nightly rates) 
in Edinburgh. Sample code is provided below, but you will need to fill in the blanks.

```{r price-histogram, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(data = ___, mapping = aes(x = ___)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(
    x = "Airbnb listing price, in £",
    y = "Frequency",
    title = "Distribution of Airbnb nightly rates in Edinburgh"
  )
```

```{r price-histogram-hint-1}
ggplot(data = edibnb, mapping = aes(x = ___)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(
    x = "Airbnb listing price, in £",
    y = "Frequency",
    title = "Distribution of Airbnb nightly rates in Edinburgh"
  )
```

```{r price-histogram-solution}
ggplot(data = edibnb, mapping = aes(x = price)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(
    x = "Airbnb listing price, in £",
    y = "Frequency",
    title = "Distribution of Airbnb nightly rates in Edinburgh"
  )
```

```{r price-histogram-check}
grade_this_code("And note that there are a couple warnings, we'll get to those in a bit.")
```


### Interpreting the histogram

```{r price-shape-quiz-1}
quiz(
  caption = "",
  question("Which of the following describes the shape of the distribution of nightly rates of Airbnb edibnb in Edinburgh? Check all that apply.",
           answer("Right skewed",
                  correct = TRUE),
           answer("Left skewed",
                  message = "Skew is on the side of the longer tail"),
           answer("Symmetric",
                  message = "If you were to draw a vertical line down the middle of the x-axis, would the left and right sides of the distribution look like mirror images?"),
           answer("Unimodal",
                  correct = TRUE),
           answer("Bimodal",
                  message = "How many prominent peaks, or modes, do you see? (recall \"bi\" means \"two\")"),
           answer("Multimodal",
                  message = "A distribution is said to be multimodal if there are three or more prominent peaks. How many prominent peaks, or modes, do you see?"),
           allow_retry = TRUE),
  question("Which of the following is false?",
           answer("There are no listings with a nightly rate above £1,250."),
           answer("More than 50% of listings have a nightly rate below £250."),
           answer("More than 25% of listings have a nightly rate above £500.",
                  correct = TRUE),
           answer("It is possible that some of the listings have a nightly rate of £0."),
           allow_retry = TRUE)
)
```


### Faceted histograms

Create a faceted histogram where each facet represents a neighbourhood and displays the distribution of Airbnb prices in that neighbourhood. Sample code is provided below, but you will need to fill in the blanks.

```{r faceted-histo, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(data = ___, mapping = aes(x = ___)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~___) +
  labs(
    x = "Airbnb listing price, in £",
    y = "Frequency",
    title = "Distribution of Airbnb nightly rates in Edinburgh",
    subtitle = "By neighbourhood"
  )
```

```{r faceted-histo-hint-1}
ggplot(data = edibnb, mapping = aes(x = ___)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~___) +
  labs(
    x = "Airbnb listing price, in £",
    y = "Frequency",
    title = "Distribution of Airbnb nightly rates in Edinburgh",
    subtitle = "By neighbourhood"
  )
```

```{r faceted-histo-hint-2}
ggplot(data = edibnb, mapping = aes(x = price)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~___) +
  labs(
    x = "Airbnb listing price, in £",
    y = "Frequency",
    title = "Distribution of Airbnb nightly rates in Edinburgh",
    subtitle = "By neighbourhood"
  )
```

```{r faceted-histo-solution}
ggplot(data = edibnb, mapping = aes(x = price)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~neighbourhood) +
  labs(
    x = "Airbnb listing price, in £",
    y = "Frequency",
    title = "Distribution of Airbnb nightly rates in Edinburgh",
    subtitle = "By neighbourhood"
  )
```

```{r faceted-histo-check}
grade_this_code("You've successfully created a faceted histogram.")
```

### What do the warnings mean?

You'll see in the above code that R gives us a couple of *warnings*. Let's analyse these:

#### Binwidth warning

```
`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.
```

The binwidth of a histogram defines the width each bar (bin) spans. Since we haven't specified a particular value in `geom_histogram()`, R picks one for us, but it also lets us know that it would be better for us to pick a `binwidth` intentionally. We'll get to practice this in a bit.

#### Removed rows warning

```
Warning: Removed 199 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin).
```

This second warning is a consequence of the fact that we are working with a real-world dataset, and thus some of the values in the data are missing (we don't know the prices for those listings) and are encoded as `NA`s. If we don't know the price, we can't represent it on the plot.

This doesn't stop R from creating the histogram, but it does mean some observations are omitted from this visualisation (199 of them, to be precise).


### Binwidth experimentation

Instead of having R pick a `binwidth` itself, try out different binwidths using the code below:

```{r binwidth-test, exercise = TRUE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = ___, mapping = aes(x = ___)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = ___) +
  facet_wrap(~___) +
  labs(
    x = "Airbnb listing price, in £",
    y = "Frequency",
    title = "Distribution of Airbnb nightly rates in Edinburgh"
  )
```

What is a reasonable value for the `binwidth` parameter? Put your answer in the block below:

```{r reasonable-binwidth, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r reasonable-binwidth-check}
grade_this({
  if(.result >= 20 & .result <= 100) {
    pass("That's a suitable binwidth")
    }
  if(.result < 20) {
    fail("That binwidth seems quite small. See how narrow the bins are using that width.")
  }
  if(.result > 100) {
    fail("That binwidth seems quite large. See how wide the bins are using that width.")
  }
  fail("Invalid binwidth.")
})
```


### Deconstructing the code

Let’s deconstruct this code:

- `ggplot()` is the function we are using to build our plot, in layers.
- In the first layer we always define the data frame as the first argument. Then, we define the mappings between the variables in the dataset and the **aes**thetics of the plot (e.g. x and y coordinates, colours, etc.).
- In the next layer we represent the data with **geom**etric shapes, in this case with a histogram. As you've just seen, it's good to try a few options to find a reasonable binwidth.
- In the final layer we facet the data by neighbourhood.

### Visualising review scores

Create a similar visualisation, this time showing the distribution of review scores (`review_scores_rating`) across neighbourhoods.

```{r reviews-histogram, exercise = TRUE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = ___, mapping = aes(x = ___)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~___) +
  labs(
    x = "Average rating score of property",
    y = "Frequency",
    title = "Distribution of Airbnb rating scores in Edinburgh",
    subtitle = "By neighbourhood"
  )
```

```{r reviews-histogram-solution}
ggplot(data = edibnb, mapping = aes(x = review_scores_rating)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~neighbourhood) +
  labs(
    x = "Average rating score of property",
    y = "Frequency",
    title = "Distribution of Airbnb rating scores in Edinburgh",
    subtitle = "By neighbourhood"
  )
```

```{r reviews-histogram-check}
grade_this_code("Your solution is correct!")
```

### Popular neighbourhoods

Which neighbourhood has the most ratings around 100%? Report your answer as a text string in quotation marks, e.g. for Tollcross, type in `"Tollcross"`.

```{r ratings-neighbourhood, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r ratings-neighbourhood-hint}
Did you forget to add the quotation marks?
```

```{r ratings-neighbourhood-check}
grade_this({
  if(identical(tolower(.result), "leith")) {
    pass("Leith has the highest number of perfect ratings.")
  }
  fail("Not quite. Try looking at the height of the bars and the labels of the x-axis.")
})
```

```{r reviews-quiz}
question("How do users generally rate properties on Airbnb?",
  answer("Generally positively",
         correct = TRUE),
  answer("Generally negatively."),
  answer("Can't say from the visualisation."),
  correct = "Correct!",
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

## Wrap up

Congratulations, you've finished the first tutorial! We hope that you enjoyed practising your data handling, visualisation, and interpretation skills along the way.
